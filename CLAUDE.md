PRODUCT DEFINITION
==================
Athens Monitor answers one question:
"Is anything happening in Athens right now that changes your day?"

This question is the filter for everything:
- Fire on Parnitha? YES — allergies, kids outside
- Metro strike? YES — changes how you get to work
- Riots at Syntagma? YES — you avoid the area
- Rape in Kallithea? NO — tragic but doesn't change your day
- Minister's statement? NO
- 4.2R earthquake? YES — you want to know

If an incident doesn't change a citizen's behavior or movement
in Athens today, it doesn't belong on the map.

This drives: what sources we add, what the filter allows,
what UI we build, what we reject.
